# One Sample Means T-Test

A marine biologist believes that great white sharks off the coast of Bermuda grow much longer due to unusual feeding habits. Three adult great white sharks around Bermuda were captured and their lengths were measured to test this claim. We will use a t-test to see if the true mean length of great white shark around Bermuda is more than 21 feet, which is the average length of all great white sharks.

A t-test is used to make inferences about a population mean of a normal distribution with a small sample size. In order to use a t-test, we must check that all assumptions have been met.

# Conditions for Small Sample T-Test

1. A random sample from the target population.
2. The population from which a sample is selected has a normal distribution.

Since the great white sharks were randomly captured around Bermuda, we will consider the first assumption to be met. In order to see if our data comes from a normal distribution, we will use a histogram and a normal quantile plot.
